How to parse a DIM web URL into a DIM wishlist line.

A DIM wishlist line looks like this
dimwishlist:item=4248569242&perks=106909392,1523832109,3108830275#notes:Heritage - Reconstruction

The numbers come from the DIM web URL when you select a given item from your inventory and the click the name.
You wil get a web URL like this:
https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/db/items/4248569242?perks=918679156,1467527085,3142289711,3300816228,588594999,4248210736,2323986101,518224744


Ok, so lets start to break this down.
item=<item #> this the the number at the items/ in the URL
perks=<perk #s> this is a comma seperated list of the perks you want this build of the weapon to have. This comes from the list of numbers
  in the URL after the ?perks= 
For an example lets break down the URL from above. Are perks are
918679156,1467527085,3142289711,3300816228,588594999,4248210736,2323986101,518224744
<Frame #>,<Barrel #>,<Perk 1>,<Perk 2>,<Perk 3>,<don't really care after this>

The first number is the frame type. This one usually isn't needed since a specific type of gun usually only has 1 type of frame
The second number is the first column in the Weapon Perks area of the DIM item This is uaually the Barrel type
The thrid number is the next perk. Depending on the gun it can have 2 to 3 perks after the barrel. These are usually the perke you want to focus
on.
